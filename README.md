# vba-challenge

I've included three formats for the vba code: .cls, .vba, and .vbs (the format used in the bootcamp gitlab).
None of them open automatically into vba, however they each open in texteditor and can be copied into vba.
They also may be opened in vscode and run with the appropriate add-on, although I have not tested this option.
PNGs for each year of stock data are included.
Last are the excel files: a copy of each with macros enabled and disabled.
The code should open and run in the macros enabled excel files upon opening the developer menu.
